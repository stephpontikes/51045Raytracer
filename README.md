# MPCS 51045 Raytracer

This is Stephen Pontikes and Logan Sherwin's MPCS 51045 (Advanced C++) Final Project submission.

This project is meant to showcase the advanced programming techniques (both specific to C++ and not) in order
to accomplish our chosen task: writing a ray tracer than can render images.

This project, despite having been submitted, is a work in progress. Future plans include finishing the inclusion of an
OpenCL script that will speed up our engine, hopefully allowing the raytracer to run and render images in real time.

## Running CMake

```{bash}
cmake CMakeLists.txt -B build
cd build
make
./MPCS51045_Raytracer
```
